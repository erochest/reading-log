In *The God We Never Knew*, Marcus Borg contrasts the God most people
were taught about growing up—remote, authoritarian, monarchical—with a
different way of looking at God. This God was just as present in the
Christian scriptures and tradition, although it has perhaps not been
dominant for much of Christian history.

This conception of/metaphor for the divine that Borg is trying to
introduce more broadly is called *panentheism*. In this, God is
everywhere, on some level present and entangled with the entire
material universe.  I've heard someone else describe this way of
looking at the relationship between the material universe (and us) and
God as being between a ship on the ocean floor and the ocean. The ship
is in the ocean, and the ocean is in the ship. But the ship doesn't
contain the ocean: the ocean is far vaster than this ship.

My favorite chapter in this was probably chapter six, "The Dream of
God: A Politics of Compassion." As I've hinted at elsewhere, my
politics is slowly changing and becoming a more public part of my
life, and the phrase, *a politics of compassion* particularly
resonated as one path into the values that I want guiding my
politics. I'd like to look at other discussions using that term and
think more deeply about it, push more on that phrase.
