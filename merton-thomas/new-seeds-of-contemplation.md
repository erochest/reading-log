This book is written by [Thomas Merton][merton], a Trappist monk who was
interested in meditation, interfaith dialogue, and social justice.

I like the balance between inner care and inner life and action in the
outer world, between realizing our shared interconnectedness and acting on
this insight. I like the way that Merton (and other
mystics/contemplatives) communicate through paradox. On one level, their
use of language is often quite traditional. On another level, it makes
little sense and is quietly struggling against the limits of language and
knowability.
