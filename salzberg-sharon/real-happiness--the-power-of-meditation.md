I wouldn't normally go for a book with a so-obviously self-helpy title
like *Real Happiness*, but I've been practicing meditation for several
years now, and I've tried to read books on this from a number of
perspectives: Buddhism, where the long-term knowledge is; Christian
contemplation, which is my background; and secular contemplation,
which doesn't try to align itself with any particular religious
trandition. I've also read some of Sharon Salzberg's posts on the
[On Being blog](http://onbeing.org/blog/), so I went ahead and got
this short book.

And it turned out to be excellent. It's a great introduction/refresher
on different kinds of meditation. It takes four weeks, and each week
it focuses on different things (breath and starting over, the body,
though and emotions, and lovingkindness). It gives you and overview of
what meditation does for those areas and how to meditate in a way that
pays attention to those areas.
