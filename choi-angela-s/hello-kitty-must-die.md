I read this book first a while back. Off-hand, I don't remember what made
me read it. Probably I saw someone recommend it, and it had a lot of
things I like in a book: a <span property="e:genre"
resource="etag:mystery">mystery</span>, a bit raw, <span
property="e:genre" resource="etag:humor">funny</span>.

I really liked it. It's a great read.

It's also written by an Asian American woman, and as the father of two
Asian American kids and as the father of a daughter, I try to look out for
books written by women and books written by Asian Americans about their
experiences. And this book is a fascinating critique and celebration of
the experience of being an <span property="p:theme_of"
resource="etag:asian-american">Asian American</span> <span
property="p:theme_of" resource="etag:womens-experience">woman</span>.

It is, simplistically, a story of self-discovery and -actualization
through murder.

I enjoyed this book so much, I wanted to share it, and we'd started
a reading group in the [Scholars' Lab][slab].

But I wasn't sure it was for everyone's taste. As I remembered, the first
chapter detailed the main character's, well, claiming herself, in her own
neurotic and idiosyncratically logical way. Then, as I remembered, the
book settled down from there.

So I mentioned it to a couple of my colleagues, who are reading it, and
over [DH 2016][dh2016], I re-read it.

It was both more problematic and more awesome than I remembered. It never
does really settle down, and the main character is more of an <span
property="p:theme_of" resource="etag:anti-hero">anti-hero</span> than
I recalled.

To be honest, I'm a little embarrassed by how much I like it. The main
character is a relatable and loveable, but not even vaguely likeable. When
she finally kills someone, it's almost a relief. And there's never
a moment's thought that maybe, just maybe, all this killing might be
wrong. The only problem is that they might get caught.

So, highly, highly recommended, but it's also not for everyone.
