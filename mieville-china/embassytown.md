*Embassytown* is a book about a simile.

The girl, Avice Benner Cho, becomes a simile by going into an
abandoned building with some aliens, and she comes out also being *the
girl who was hurt in the dark and ate what was given to her*.

She had to become a simile so that she could become part of Language,
the language of the Ariekei, the indiginous sentient beings of the
world on which Embassytown was. Language was apparently unique among
the languages of the universe because in order for an Ariekes to say
something or even to think it, it needed to coorespond to reality in
someway.

This book managed to hold off all my doubts about this premise
(narratively, linguistically, philosophically) long enough for me to
buy into the book. For one thing, while often the premise of a
language restricted by truth is used as a way to examine *truth*,
which just doesn't work for me, Miéville used it as a way to examine
language and the relationship between language and thought. How does
language restrict or enable though? How do similes work? What does
metaphor get you?
