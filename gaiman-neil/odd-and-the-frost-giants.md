*Odd and the Frost Giants* is a <span property="e:genre" resource="etag:bildungsroman">coming of age story</span> about a young man who runs away from home after his father dies and his mother remarries. He travels into what is turning into an eternal winter. He encounters an eagle, a bear, and a fox, who turn out to be Odin, Thor, and Loki transformed. He goes with them to free Asgard from a frost giant and return spring to the world before returning home.

I started reading this again to my daughter one night. At first she wasn't interested, but by the end of the first chapter, she didn't want me to stop.
