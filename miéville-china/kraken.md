*Kraken*'s a romp though the magical underworld world of London.

Though not explicitly religious, it touches on belief on many, many levels. In fact, magic works through belief, and in the end, the main character's magic comes from his belief in what it is. The bad guy (or one of them, anyway) is motivated by belief and angered by his lack of belief.

This book was fun. I need to read it again soon.
