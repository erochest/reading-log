This is a <span property="e:genre" resource="etag:fantasy">fantasy</span>/<span property="e:genre" resource="etag:horror">horror</span> novella about Lucretia, a young girl who has to climb into apartment 6D, where a family of menacing mutants live, in order to rescue her best friend, Sunny, who is dying of cancer.

It's a heart-breaking story about a girl coming to terms with her the death of her best friend. Paradoxically, in the fantasy world, Sunny is the stronger of the two, mentally at least, and shows Lucretia how to live while under the spectre of death.

This takes place in the same world as LaValle's novel <em property="p:will_lead_to" resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/741540136">The Devil in Silver</em>, which is on my list to read someday.
