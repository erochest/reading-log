The Genealogy of Reading project emerged from a curiosity about the
shape of personal reading habits: what books caused me to read other
books, and how the books I’ve read helped develop thematic networks
over time.

The project takes an abstract model of linked open data and applies it
to a web-based project on personal reading habits. Undertaking the
project itself affords ways to learn the constraints and opportunities
of linked data for myself and creates a sandbox for thinking about
leveraging linked data in a variety of other contexts. Visualizations
will help map relationships between books—particularly to get a sense
of what books cause me to read other books, explore the regional
distribution of authors, and reveal broad themes within a cohort of
books.

In her keynote at the 2015 Canadian Congrees of the Humanities and
Social Sciences,
{% rsc_span http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azar_Nafisi Person %}
Azar Nafisi{% endrsc_span %}
[presented](http://congress2015.ca/program/events/nafisi) the
inspiration and need of her new book <a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/885983017" typeof="Text"
property="creator">The Republic of the Imagination</a>. Making a
powerful argument on the significance of reading, Nafisi suggests
reading - reading anything, everything - expands the reader's
creativity, courage, and empahty. She prompted me to expand my
interest in the relationships between my books to question if I could
begin to trace broader themes or concerns across my personal library?
Could I begin to see hints of why I read, or why I am reading a
particular way?


## Books Nafisi references?

a way to start adding links out to actual book records

* <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Nabokov"
  typeof="Person" property="referenced">Vladimir Nabokov</a>
*  <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Baldwin" typeof="Person"
   property="referenced">James Baldwin</a>
* <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/C._S._Lewis" typeof="Person"
  property="referenced">CS Lewis</a>
* <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jane_Austen" typeof="Person"
  property="referenced">Jane Austen</a>

## Books read, inspired by Azar Nafisi's talk:

Shortly after Nafisi's talk, I re-read
{% rsc_span http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italo_Calvino Person %}Italo
Calvino's{% endrsc_span %} <a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7197128" typeof="Text"
property="creator">If On A Winter's Night A Traveler</a>, which led to
re-reading <a href ="http://uva.worldcat.org/oclc/3380425"
typeof="Text" property="creator">Invisible Cities</a>.

Nafisi prompted me to consider the author's engagement with the
reader, to books about reading. <!--more text here...why is this

In a sense, I am not yet sure what this project will actually do. I
hope it will reveal a sense of the relationships between themes and
authors evolve over the course of a few weeks, months, or years. At
the moment, I want to track:

* books that have both inspiring the next reading and (inspired by)
reflect back on past readings;
* author,
* publisher,
* translation (yes/no),
* location of publication (us, spain, etc)
* genre,
* date of 1st publication,
* date of reading (start and finish),
* categories (list out) important to me
* themes/categories on dbpedia
* dbpedia's listing of influenced by and influenced

A few additional goals and questions:

1. experiments with visualization as finding aid
2. could we develop a way to recommend or highlight areas I haven't
   read based on dbpedia record of full works of author, other authors
   that have influenced the author, and authors who have been
   influenced by the author
