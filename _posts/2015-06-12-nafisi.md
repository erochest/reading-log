## Books Nafisi references?

a way to start adding links out to actual book records

* <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Nabokov" typeof="Person" property="referenced">Vladimir Nabokov</a>
* <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Baldwin" typeof="Person" property="referenced">James Baldwin</a>
* <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/C._S._Lewis" typeof="Person" property="referenced">CS Lewis</a>
* <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jane_Austen" typeof="Person" property="referenced">Jane Austen</a>

## Books read, inspired by Azar Nafisi's talk:

Shortly after Nafisi's talk, I re-read <span
resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italo_Calvino"
typeof="Person" property="purdom:lead_to">Italo Calvino's</span> <a
href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7197128" typeof="Text"
property="creator">If On A Winter's Night A Traveler</a>, which led to
re-reading <a href="http://uva.worldcat.org/oclc/3380425"
typeof="Text" property="creator">Invisible Cities</a>.

Nafisi prompted me to consider the author's engagement with the
reader, to books about reading. <!--more text here...why is this
interesting? --!>

In a sense, I am not yet sure what this project will actually do. I
hope it will reveal a sense of the relationships between themes and
authors evolve over the course of a few weeks, months, or years. At
the moment, I want to track:

* books that have both inspiring the next reading and (inspired by)
reflect back on past readings;
* author,
* publisher,
* translation (yes/no),
* location of publication (us, spain, etc)
* genre,
* date of 1st publication,
* date of reading (start and finish),
* categories (list out) important to me
* themes/categories on dbpedia
* dbpedia's listing of influenced by and influenced

A few additional goals and questions:

1. experiments with visualization as finding aid
2. could we develop a way to recommend or highlight areas I haven't
   read based on dbpedia record of full works of author, other authors
   that have influenced the author, and authors who have been
   influenced by the author
