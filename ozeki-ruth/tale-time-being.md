This is a fascinating book about choice, how we interact with reality,
creativity, the power of reading, the balance of creativity, suicide, and
lots of other things.

This book mentions a number of other books, and it contains
a bibliography. So it is leading me to read a number of other books, some
of which, picked at pseudo-random:

* *Reflections on the Way to the Gallows*, by Kanno Sugako.
* *The Bluestockings of Japan*, by Jan Bardsley.
* *The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III*, by Peter Byrne.
* *Mount Analogue*, by René Daumal.
* *Shōbōgenzō*, by Eihei Dōgen.
* *The Book of Laughter and Forgetting*, by Milan Kundera.
* *Scrolling Forward*, by David Levy.
* *Zone of Emptiness*, by Hiroshi Noma.
* *In Search of Lost Time*, by Marcel Proust.
* *Narrating the Self*, by Tomi Suzuki.

And probably most importantly, I set it down and immediately started
planning when I would re-read it. I'd like to read more of the works that
I've listed above, but once I do, I plan to revisit this world again.
