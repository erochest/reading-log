I read this short memoir after reading about it in <span resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/796756004" property="p:inspired_by"><a href="/reading-log/ozeki-ruth/tale-time-being">*Tale for the Time Being*</a></span>.

It's an interesting blend of the personal, the ideological, and the political at every level. She talks a lot of her friends and the comfort she gets from them, the disappointment and pain when they reject her. It's fascinating and touching to watch how much they care about each other and the strength they get from each other. I'm always fascinated by the intersection of the personal and public/political/professional.

A tangent: I found a copy of this book in the [Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kanno-sugako-reflections-on-the-way-to-the-gallows).
