I started in the middle of Atwood's *Oryx and Crake* series on the advice of a friend. This was a good jumping in place: right on the edge, beyond dystopia and watching humanity die (or something). Now I'm waiting to get the first book from the library.

There's been a lot of talk about dystopian and postapocalyptic literature following the election, as we wait for President Trump. Are we projecting our fears? Are we looking for hope? (After all, I haven't seen a postapocalyptic novel yet that doesn't include recognizable humans in some fashion. The only possible [non-human] exception to this might be the Monument-Makers from Jack McDevitt's *Engines of God*, who appeared to have devolved after their civilization was destroyed multiple times. Others?)
